# [Computation of Scalar Products](@id ComputationOfScalarProducts)

By now, we are able to construct orthogonal polynomials, and to construct quadrature rules for a given nonnegative weight function, respectively.
Now we combine both ideas to solve integrals involving the orthogonal polynomials

```math
\langle \phi_{i_1} \phi_{i_2} \cdots \phi_{i_{m-1}}, \phi_{i_m} \rangle
= \int \phi_{i_1}(t) \phi_{i_2}(t) \cdots \phi_{i_{m-1}}(t) \phi_{i_m}(t) w(t) \mathrm{d} t,
```

both for the univariate and multivariate case.
The integrand is a polynomial (possibly multivariate) that can be solved exactly with the appropriate Gauss quadrature rules.

!!! note
    
    To simplify notation, we drop the integration interval.
    It is clear from the context.

## Univariate Polynomials

### Classical Polynomials

Let's begin with a univariate basis for some *classical* orthogonal polynomial

```@example mysetup
using PolyChaos
deg, n = 4, 20
s_α, s_β = 2.1, 3.2
opq = Beta01OrthoPoly(deg, s_α, s_β; Nrec = n, addQuadrature = true)
```

By setting `addQuadrature = true` (which is default), an $n$-point Gauss quadrature rule is created relative to the underlying measure `opq.measure`, where $n$ is the number of recurrence coefficients stored in `opq.α` and `opq.β`.

To compute the squared norms

```math
\| \phi_k \|^2 = \langle \phi_k, \phi_k  \rangle
= \int \phi_k(t) \phi_k(t) w(t) \mathrm{d} t
```

of the basis we call `computeSP2()`

```@example mysetup
normsq = computeSP2(opq)
```

For the general case

```math
\langle \phi_{i_1} \phi_{i_2} \cdots \phi_{i_{m-1}}, \phi_{i_m} \rangle
= \int \phi_{i_1}(t) \phi_{i_2}(t) \cdots \phi_{i_{m-1}}(t) \phi_{i_m}(t) w(t) \mathrm{d} t,
```

there exists a type `Tensor` that requires only two arguments: the *dimension* $m \geq 1$, and an `AbstractOrthoPoly`

```@example mysetup
m = 3
t = Tensor(3, opq)
```

To get the desired entries, `Tensor` comes with a `get()` function that is called for some index $a \in \mathbb{N}_0^m$ that has the entries $a = [i_1, i_2, \dots, i_m]$.
For example

```@example mysetup
t.get([1, 2, 3])
```

Or using comprehension

```@example mysetup
T = [t.get([i1, i2, i3])
     for i1 in 0:(dim(opq) - 1), i2 in 0:(dim(opq) - 1), i3 in 0:(dim(opq) - 1)]
```

Notice that we can cross-check the results.

```@example mysetup
using LinearAlgebra
normsq == diag(T[:, :, 1]) == diag(T[:, 1, :]) == diag(T[1, :, :])
```

Also, `normsq` can be computed analogously in `Tensor` format

```@example mysetup
t2 = Tensor(2, opq)
normsq == [t2.get([i, i]) for i in 0:(dim(opq) - 1)]
```

### Arbitrary Weights

Of course, the type `OrthoPoly` can be constructed for arbitrary weights $w(t)$.
In this case, we have to compute the orthogonal basis and the respective quadrature rule.
Let's re-work the above example manually.

```@example mysetup
using SpecialFunctions
supp = (0, 1)
w(t) = (t^(s_α - 1) * (1 - t)^(s_β - 1) / SpecialFunctions.beta(s_α, s_β))
my_meas = Measure("my_meas", w, supp, false)
my_opq = OrthoPoly("my_op", deg, my_meas; Nrec = n, addQuadrature = true)
```

Now we can compute the squared norms $\| \phi_k \|^2$

```@example mysetup
my_normsq = computeSP2(my_opq)
```

And the tensor

```@example mysetup
my_t = Tensor(m, my_opq)
my_T = [my_t.get([i1, i2, i3])
        for i1 in 0:(dim(opq) - 1), i2 in 0:(dim(opq) - 1), i3 in 0:(dim(opq) - 1)]
```

Let's compare the results:

```@example mysetup
abs.(normsq - my_normsq)
```

```@example mysetup
norm(T - my_T)
```

!!! note
    
    The possibility to create quadrature rules for arbitrary weights should be reserved to cases different from *classical* ones.

## Multivariate Polynomials

For multivariate polynomials, the syntax for `Tensor` is very much alike, except that we are dealing with the type `MultiOrthoPoly` now.

```@example mysetup
mop = MultiOrthoPoly([opq, my_opq], deg)
```

```@example mysetup
mt2 = Tensor(2, mop)
mt3 = Tensor(3, mop)
mT2 = [mt2.get([i, i]) for i in 0:(dim(mop) - 1)]
```

Notice that `mT2` carries the elements of the 2-dimensional tensors for the univariate bases `opq` and `my_opq`.
The encoding is given by the multi-index `mop.ind`

```@example mysetup
mop.ind
```

To cross-check the results, we can distribute the multi-index back to its univariate indices with the help of `findUnivariateIndices`.

```@example mysetup
ind_opq = findUnivariateIndices(1, mop.ind)
ind_my_opq = findUnivariateIndices(2, mop.ind)
```

```@example mysetup
mT2[ind_opq] - normsq
```

```@example mysetup
mT2[ind_my_opq] - my_normsq
```
